# Letex-Report-
This LaTeX code defines a basic document using the article class with 12pt font size on A4 paper. The geometry package is used to set the margins. 

The document contains one section titled "This is the first section" with some text under it. Inside this section, there is one subsection titled "First subsection in first section" with the text "Hello world!" and one subsubsection titled "First subsubsection" with some low-level text.

Overall, it's a simple LaTeX document structure with a section, subsection, and subsubsection, demonstrating how to organize content hierarchically.

```
\documentclass[12pt,a4paper]{article}
\usepackage[hmargin=4.5cm,
vmargin=4.5cm]{geometry}

\begin{document}

\section{This is the first section}
Text corresponding to this section goes here.  Some preliminary
sentences could go first, before the subsections start. 




\subsection{First subsection in first section}
Hello world!


\subsubsection{First subsubsection}
Low level text.  Some more text.

\end{document}
